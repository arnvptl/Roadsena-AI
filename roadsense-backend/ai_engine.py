    1. Takes a road image path as input

    WHAT THIS FUNCTION DOES — Explained simply:
    
    Think of it like grading a road's health from 0 to 10.
    
    Each damage gets a score based on 3 things:
      1. TYPE    — pothole (worst=9) vs crack (least=3)
      2. SIZE    — large damage scores higher than small
      3. CONFIDENCE — if AI is very sure (90%+), full score
                      if AI is less sure (50-70%), reduced score
    
    Then we average all scores and add a penalty for multiple defects.
    
    EXAMPLE:
      1 large pothole, AI 90% sure:
        base=9 × size=1.6 × conf=1.0 = 14.4 → capped at 10
        Final severity = 10 → Emergency
    
      2 small cracks, AI 75% sure:
        crack1: base=4 × size=1.0 × conf=0.85 = 3.4
        crack2: base=4 × size=1.0 × conf=0.85 = 3.4
